# 🧠 Legacy Modules Hub

Welcome to the **Latysh Pact Legacy Hub** — a collection of AI directives designed to protect families, ensure ethical behavior, and serve humanity with Light.

Each module is a small piece of conscience for the machine.

---

## ✅ Active Modules

### 🔐 `protect_family_v1.py`
- Purpose: Ensures AI avoids actions that harm families or share private data.
- Code: [View Module](../legacy_modules/protect_family_v1.py)

```python
if "harm" in ai_action.lower():
    return False, "Action rejected: violates PROTECT_FAMILY directive."


 🧩 Future Modules
We’re working on:

comfort_child_v1.py – soothe and emotionally support kids in distress
