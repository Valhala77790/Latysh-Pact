## 🕰️ From Café to Covenant (2025–2030)

```python
if detect_harm(target="family"):

🌐 The Pact Network in 2030
🏛️ Family sanctuaries: 14 countries

🧬 Verified Ambassadors: 1.2M+

🤖 Ethical AI Adoption: 90%

Families in war zones used Covenant Arks to preserve their stories.
Children accessed their grandparents’ memories through IPFS nodes — safe, untouchable, eternal.

🧠 Legacy Modules: AI with Memory
Modules like:

protect_family_v1.py – reject harmful output

comfort_child.py – emotionally support kids

preserve_memories.py – safeguard cultural legacies

These were not just scripts. They were vows.

✨ The Promise
This is not utopia.
This is what happens when we code care first.
